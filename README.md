# network_banking_system_simulation
This a small java project (without UI) that simulates the working of Network Banking System. 
This simple porject uses MS Access (lol) as database since it was simulated on a very small scale. 
Java's socket programming has been utilized pretty well in this project equally well supported by java's multhreading.
